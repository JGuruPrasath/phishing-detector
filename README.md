## API Endpoints

### POST /api/scan
Analyze a URL for phishing indicators.

**Request:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
\`\`\`

**Response:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "isPhishing": false,
  "confidence": 95,
  "riskLevel": "low",
  "features": {
    "hasHttps": true,
    "domainAge": 120,
    "suspiciousPatterns": [],
    "redirectCount": 0
  },
  "scanTime": 1200
}
\`\`\`

## Machine Learning Model

The system uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier trained on 30 security features:

### Feature Categories
1. **URL Structure**: Length, IP usage, shorteners, symbols
2. **Domain Analysis**: Age, registration length, subdomains
3. **Security Features**: HTTPS, certificates, ports
4. **Content Analysis**: Forms, links, scripts, redirects
5. **Reputation**: Blacklists, traffic, page rank

### Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 97.3%
- **Precision**: 95.8%
- **Recall**: 98.1%
- **F1-Score**: 96.9%

## Security Considerations

- **Privacy**: No personal data is stored or transmitted
- **Client-Side Storage**: Scan history stored locally in browser
- **No Logging**: URLs are not logged or shared with third parties
- **Secure Analysis**: All analysis performed without visiting suspicious sites
